# QueueSense Screenshot Checklist

Capture each page at 1440px width (or closest) once the Netlify deployment is live. Save PNGs into this folder using the naming convention below:

1. `01-login.png`
2. `02-home.png`
3. `03-clinic.png`
4. `04-dmv.png`
5. `05-notifications.png`
6. `06-dashboard.png`
7. `07-system.png`
8. `08-settings.png`

Tips:
- Ensure the fake data (wait times, charts) is visible without scrolling.
- Hover on at least one interactive element to showcase micro-interactions.
- Include the browser chrome or drop shadows so the captures feel real.
