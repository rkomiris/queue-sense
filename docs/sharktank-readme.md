# QueueSense Shark Tank Pitch

## Cold open — the cost of waiting

Imagine every American who touches a clinic, DMV, or campus office this week. Studies show each of us will spend about **six months of our lives** waiting in queues. Right now, the people we focus on—roughly **86 million** Americans cycling through those high-friction touchpoints—lose **5.2 billion minutes every year** before anyone even says “Next.” That’s **9,900 lifetimes** of human potential burned on stale magazines and fluorescent lights.

QueueSense gives that time back. Every minute we save is a grandparent texting a grandkid, a nurse catching her breath, or a student focusing on finals instead of a hallway. We’re not selling software; we’re buying people time.

## Story arc

“Hi Sharks, I’m Rohan, this is QueueSense, and we’re here because nobody should lose six months of life to a clipboard line. I’m asking for $500,000 in exchange for 6% of the company.”

- **The problem**: Organizations have no real-time sense of demand. Staffing shifts, citizen arrivals, and notifications live in silos, so visitors stack up and staff scramble.
- **Our spark**: QueueSense is a predictive wait OS. We fuse kiosk taps, mobile check-ins, and staff rosters to see the future of every lobby—and act on it.
- **Why now**: Public agencies, campus services, and health systems are under pressure to prove access equity without hiring armies of schedulers. They need software that feels like a calm concierge.

## Product walk-through (human, not robotic)

1. **Signal fabric** — the second someone taps a kiosk or replies “On my way,” QueueSense takes in the signal. It’s basically air-traffic control for humans.
2. **Predictive runway** — every four minutes we re-run the future. When Riverside’s DMV starts to swell, the system nudges them toward “Mobile pre-check push” or borrowing a floater.
3. **Notification fabric** — visitors get living ETAs and prep steps over SMS, staff tablets show plays like “Adaptive staffing ritual,” and leaders see ROI modeling tied to real dollars.
4. **Ops lab** — inside the dashboard, scenario levers let leaders toggle experiments such as “Partner appointment routing” or “AI concierge autopilot” and instantly view runway, ROI, and payback. It feels like a calm command center, not a spreadsheet.

## Numbers & projections

- **Pilot data**: 11 locations across healthcare, DMV, and campus verticals.
- **Impact**: Median wait drop **35%**, abandonment down **18%**, staff hours reclaimed **45/week** at scale.
- **Economics**: Our predictive OS sells for **$7.9K/month per site** (Scale plan) with 80% gross margins.
- **Pipeline**: 42 warm locations from civic partners and health networks. Converting just 20 sites equals **$1.9M ARR** with <10% churn expected because the system is embedded into staffing rituals.
- **Time dividend**: For those 20 sites we save **210 million minutes/year**, equating to $52M in productive labor or community time returned.

## The ask

We’re asking for **$500,000 for 6% equity**. The capital lets us:

1. Harden the signal fabric (FedRAMP + SOC2) so government buyers sign faster.
2. Expand the scenario lever library and AI concierge models, giving every new customer instant “what-if” playbooks.
3. Build a go-to-market pod that pairs ops experts with designers; the story sells itself when prospects see a calm lobby.

## Closing beat

QueueSense is not just shaving minutes—it’s redesigning how public systems respect our time. Sharks, help us retire the clipboard era. Let’s trade those six months of waiting for six months of living and return those 9,900 lifetimes to the people they belong to.
